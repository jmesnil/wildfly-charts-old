# Helm Chart for WildFly

A Helm chart for building and deploying a [Wildly](https://www.wildfly.org) application on OpenShift.

The build and deploy steps are configured in separate `build` and `deploy` values.

The input of the `build` step is a Git repository that contains the application code and the output is an `ImageStreamTag` resource that contains the built application image.

The input of the `deploy` step is an `ImageStreamTag` resource that contains the built application image and the output is a `DeploymentConfig` and related resources to access the application from inside and outside OpenShift.

## Prerequisites
Below are prerequisites that may apply to your use case.

### Pull Secret
You will need to create a pull secret if you need to pull an image from an external registry that requires authentication. Use the following command as a reference to create your pull secret:
```bash
oc create secret docker-registry my-pull-secret --docker-server=$REGISTRY_URL --docker-username=$USERNAME --docker-password=$PASSWORD --docker-email=$EMAIL
```

You can use this secret by passing `--set build.pullSecret=my-pull-secret` to `helm install`, or you can configure this in a values file:
```yaml
build:
  pullSecret: my-pull-secret
```
and apply by passing `-f $VALUES_FILE`.

## Application Image

The configuration for the image that is built and deployed is configured in a `image` section.

| Value | Description | Default | Additional Information |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| `image.name` | Name of the image you want to build/deploy | Defaults to the Helm release name. | The chart will create/reference an [ImageStream](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html) based on this value. |
| `image.tag` | Tag that you want to build/deploy | `latest` | The chart will create/reference an [ImageStreamTag](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html#images-using-imagestream-tags_image-streams-managing) based on the name provided |

## Building the Application

The configuration to build the application image is configured in a `build` section.

| Value | Description | Default | Additional Information |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| `build.enabled` | Determines if build-related resources should be created. | `true` | Set this to `false` if you want to deploy a previously built image. Leave this set to `true` if you want to build and deploy a new image. |
